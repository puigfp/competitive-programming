# competitive-programming

Repo for storing my solutions to competitive programming problems.

This repo replaces the previous repo I was using for this purpose: https://github.com/puigfp/ProblemSolvingPython

This repo was literally the first Git repo I every pushed code to. This means most stuff is in French (notes about the problems, commit messages and even the function/variable names of some solutions) and the code isn't the prettiest code I've ever written...
