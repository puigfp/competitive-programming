# competitive-programming

Repo for storing my solutions to competitive programming problems.

This repo replaces the previous repo I was using for this purpose: https://github.com/puigfp/ProblemSolvingPython

This repo was literally the first Git repo I every pushed code to. This means most stuff is in French (notes about the problems, commit messages and even the function/variable names of some solutions) and the code isn't the prettiest code I've ever written...

Some `notes.md` files have LaTeX equations in them, which are, at the time of writing, not rendered by Github (expected). You can either use [the Markdown+Math VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) or [Typora](https://www.typora.io/) to view the rendered equations.
