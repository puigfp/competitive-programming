Key observations:

> this is a perfect maze (in particular, distances between keys do not change when a door is opened)

> for part 2, the problem can be split into 4 independent problems, one for each part of the maze, when solving the subproblems, we can ignore the doors whose keys aren't in the same part of the maze
